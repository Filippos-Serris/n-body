# N-body Problem in C Programming Language

## Introduction
N-Body problem is an astro-physics problem about the movement of the planets included in a solar system and their future position. In this thesis is studied
a very simple version of this problem. More spesific the interaction of 2 to 10 point masses with each other without taking in acount any collision or 
the existance of a solar sytem structure. The code is written in the C programming language and purpose of this thesis is to messure the execution time
between different teknicks of the same implementation.
